## Layouts
The template is based on small, content-agnostic partials that can be mixed and matched. The pre-built pages showcase just a few of the possible combinations. Refer to the site/layouts/partials folder for all available partials.

Use Hugoâ€™s dict functionality to feed content into partials and avoid repeating yourself and creating discrepancies.

## CSS
The template uses a custom fork of Tachyons and PostCSS with cssnext and cssnano. To customize the template for your brand, refer to src/css/imports/_variables.css where most of the important global variables like colors and spacing are stored.
